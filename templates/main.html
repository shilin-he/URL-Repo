    URL Repo is a bookmark manager app which runs on the Google App Engine.
    </p>
    <p>
    Currently it supports importing and exporting Firefox bookmark backup files and
    basic bookmark operations (view, add, delete and update). 
    </p>
    <p>
    Future supported functions will include the import / export of IE bookmark 
    backup files, a Firefox Add-on which is used to import the bookmarks from 
    your Firefox and export the bookmarks in your URL Repo account to your local 
    Firefox browser, and more...
