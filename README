URL Repo is a bookmark manager app which runs on the Google App Engine. 

Currently it supports importing and exporting Firefox bookmark backup files and
basic bookmark operations (view, add, delete and update). 

Future supported functions will include the import / export of IE bookmark 
backup files, a Firefox Add-on which is used to import the bookmarks from 
your Firefox and export the bookmarks in your URL Repo account to your local 
Firefox browser, and more...

The code is free to use, modify / enhance in any way you like. 
Suggestions and contributions would be highly appreciated.
