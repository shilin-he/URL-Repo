URL Repo is a bookmark manager app which runs on the Google App Engine. 

Currently it supports importing and exporting Firefox bookmark backup 
files (.json) and Netscape Bookmark format files (.htm); Also basic bookmark 
operations (view, add, delete and update) are supported. 

Future supported functions will include a Firefox Add-on which is used to 
import the bookmarks from your Firefox and export the bookmarks in your 
URL Repo account to your local Firefox browser, and more...

The code is free to use, modify / enhance in any way you like. 
Suggestions and contributions would be highly appreciated.
